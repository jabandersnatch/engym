# Project Structure #

For this project we are going to make and test 4 enviroments.
This enviromentes corresponds to a mechanical engieeniring problem.

The objective of this investigation is to show that machine learning can be aplied to
new problems instead of existing ones.

The proposed enviroments are:
* Polebuilder
## Description ##
This enviroment it's based on the branch of mechanics of materials.
The objective of this enviroment is to create a cylindrical strucutre
that is the minimun weight possible while subjected to gravity.
In this type of implementation the actor can decide on which radious use
for the set section where the current state is. The selection of radiuses
is no limit by a set of predefind radiuses, the actor can decide an infinite
amount of radius between a range.
